##Admission Control and resource Allocation for 5G Core Network Slicing based on Deep Reinforcement Learning

Network   Slicing   is   a   promising   technology   forproviding  customized  logical  and  virtualized  networks  for  theindustryâ€™s  vertical  segments.  
Distinct  use  cases  in  5G  networks,such as enhanced Mobile Broadband, Ultra-Reliable Low LatencyCommunications,  and  Massive  Internet  of  Things,  
have  theirQuality  of  Service  requirements,  which  must  be  supported.  
In line  with  that,  this  paper  proposes  an  approach  encompassing mechanisms for Admission Control and Resource Allocation fornetwork  slicing  in  5G  core  networks. 
The  Admission  Control mechanism  introduces  two  solutions  for  learning  the  admissionpolicy  that  optimizes  the  profit  of  Network  Slice  Providers,  
onebased  on  Reinforcement  Learning  (called  SARA)  and  the  otherbased  on  Deep  Reinforcement  Learning  (called  DSARA).  
TheSARA and DSARA solutions consider the 5G use cases defined bythe 3rd Generation Partnership Project. 
The Resource Allocationmechanism tries to balance the load on the network nodes as wellas  minimize  the  network  resource  utilization.
